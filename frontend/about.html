          <h3>Our Mission</h3>
          <p>
            Founded in 2138, Mars Animal Shelter is the first interplanetary
            rescue organization dedicated to the care and protection of Earth
            species adapting to the Martian environment.
          </p>
          <p>
            We believe every creature deserves a loving home, even 140 million
            miles from Earth.

          <h3>Our Facilities</h3>
          <p>
            Located in the climate-controlled Valles Marineris Colony, our
            state-of-the-art habitat domes provide Earth-like conditions for our
            animal residents.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our specialized veterinary team is trained in low-gravity animal
            care and Martian adaptation protocols.

        <div class="history">
          <h3>Our History</h3>
          <p>
            When the first Mars colonists discovered the challenges of raising
            Earth animals in Martian conditions, our founder Dr. Elena Vasquez
            established the shelter to research and develop solutions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today, we care for over 200 animals, from specially-bred Mars dogs
            to gravity-adapted cats and birds that help bring a touch of Earth
            to our red planet home.
